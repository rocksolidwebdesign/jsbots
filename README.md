# JS Bots

A game of artificial intelligence programming.

# Try It

Go [HERE](http://rocksolidwebdesign.github.io/intellibots.js/) to try it yourself.

# How to Play

Click "New Game". This will put a new set of robots and targets on the field. Then click "Run". This will start the robots in motion.

When a robot runs over a target, the robot will collect the target underneath it and a new target will appear at random somewhere else on the field. When a robot collects a target, the robot's score will increase.

# How to Score

Under the Settings area below the field, choose different combinations of input features from the left hand column and try out different configurations for the robot brains in the right hand column.

Try to find settings that generate robots with interesting and realistic behavior for finding the targets and that also find the most targets as quickly as possible.

After changing settings, you must click "New Game" to regenerate the playing field with robots that are using your new settings.
